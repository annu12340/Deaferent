A web app to help the deaf people

The life of a deaf person is pretty daunting. Using OpenCV and TensorFlow, I have built an ML model that converts their sign language into text. Furthermore, using Google Speech API I have also performed voice to text conversion so that other people can interact with them and help them communicate with ease.
