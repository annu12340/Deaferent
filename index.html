        <br> Most of us are lucky to hear the chirping of the birds, the sound of the rain, the rustling of the leaves, enjoy music etc. But not all!. Imagine a world without sound and the frustration of trying to express what you feel or need to others. This is the living nightmare that the deaf people have to endure through out their life.

                <p class="mb-0">"I do not care about not being able to listen to music or that my deafness has a negative effect on my career. I do not really care about birds chirping or the other sounds people think gets them to heaven and then drops them back safe on earth. I also do not worry about feeling lonely because it is just all quiet. But human interaction is something I crave for - the day to day casual conversations, being part of a group where I understand every joke that is being cracked and laugh with my mates without having to ask that nice person what it is about, going to a loud bar and actually make a conversation talking (not texting)"</p>
